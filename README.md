CPPKATA
=======

This mini personal project is a refference to some of the questions & problems I encountered and found interesting.
I'm using them as KATA/s to practice TDD, C/C++ and patterns.

It is here to mainly serve me, but if you find it informative, you are welcome to review and use freely.


Unit Tests:
===========

The implementations are accompanied with unit tests.
The UT/s are using my favorite UT framework, CppUTest, building and running them from one "make" away.
Just enter the make command under ./unit_tester (after installing CppUtest on your host)

- Install CppUTest: See http://cpputest.github.io
-- Note: You may need to define a system shell variable pointing to the installed CPPUTEST root: CPPUTEST_HOME=D:\cpputest


You are welcome to feedback and propose enhancements as you see fit.
